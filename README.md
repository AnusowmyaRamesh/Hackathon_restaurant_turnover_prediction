If you look at this from the business perspective for a restaurant, more popularity may mean more visits to the joint increasing the annual turnover of the restaurants. For any restaurant to survive and do well, the annual turnover of the restaurants has to be substantial. 

This problem takes a shot at predicting the annual turnover of a set of restaurants across India based on a set of variables given in the data set. This includes the data related to the restaurant such as location, opening date, cuisine type, themes etc. This also includes data pooled from different sources such as social media popularity index, Zomato ratings, etc. Lastly, it also adds a different flavour to the problem by looking at the Customer survey data as well as ratings provided by a mystery visitor data (audit done by a third party).
